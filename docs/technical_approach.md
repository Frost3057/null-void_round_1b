# Adobe India Hackathon - Round 1B Technical Approach

## Persona-Driven Document Intelligence System

### Executive Summary

This document presents our comprehensive technical approach for the Round 1B challenge: "Persona-Driven Document Intelligence." Our solution leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to intelligently identify, rank, and extract the most relevant document sections based on user-defined personas and specific job requirements.

### Problem Statement

The challenge requires developing an AI system that can:
- Process multiple PDF documents efficiently
- Understand user personas and job requirements semantically
- Identify and rank document sections by relevance
- Extract refined content suitable for the specified use case
- Operate within strict computational constraints (CPU-only, offline, <1GB model size)

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Document Processing Pipeline

#### 1.1 Structural Analysis (Round 1A Integration)
Our solution builds upon the robust outline extraction system developed in Round 1A:

- **Hierarchical Heading Detection**: Utilizes advanced PDF parsing to identify document structure (H1, H2, H3 levels)
- **Content Segmentation**: Associates text blocks with their corresponding headings to create coherent sections
- **Section Definition**: Each section encompasses content from a heading until the next heading of equal or higher hierarchical level
- **Metadata Extraction**: Captures page numbers, section positions, and structural relationships

#### 1.2 Text Extraction and Preprocessing
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles various PDF encoding types and layouts
- **Text Normalization**: Implements comprehensive cleaning (whitespace, special characters, encoding issues)
- **Language Detection**: Identifies document languages for optimized processing
- **Content Filtering**: Removes headers, footers, and non-content elements

### 2. Semantic Intelligence Engine

#### 2.1 Embedding Model Architecture
- **Model Selection**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 Sentence Transformer
  - Size: ~80MB (well within 1GB constraint)
  - Performance: 384-dimensional embeddings
  - Language Support: Multilingual capabilities
  - Optimization: CPU-optimized inference

#### 2.2 Embedding Generation Strategy
- **Persona Vectorization**: Converts user persona descriptions into semantic embeddings
- **Job Requirement Analysis**: Transforms job-to-be-done specifications into vector representations
- **Content Embedding**: Generates embeddings for each document section (title + content)
- **Query Fusion**: Combines persona and job embeddings using weighted concatenation

#### 2.3 Advanced Semantic Matching
- **Cosine Similarity Computation**: Measures semantic alignment between queries and content
- **Multi-dimensional Scoring**: Considers title relevance, content relevance, and contextual importance
- **Threshold Optimization**: Implements dynamic thresholds for relevance filtering

### 3. Intelligent Ranking System

#### 3.1 Multi-factor Relevance Scoring
Our ranking algorithm considers multiple factors:

1. **Semantic Similarity**: Primary score based on embedding cosine similarity
2. **Positional Weight**: Sections appearing earlier receive slight preference
3. **Content Density**: Longer, more substantive sections gain scoring advantage
4. **Keyword Overlap**: Traditional keyword matching as supplementary signal

#### 3.2 Ranking Algorithm
```
Final_Score = α × Semantic_Score + β × Position_Weight + γ × Content_Density + δ × Keyword_Score
```
Where α, β, γ, δ are empirically tuned weights (α=0.7, β=0.1, γ=0.1, δ=0.1)

### 4. Content Refinement and Extraction

#### 4.1 Sub-section Analysis
- **Hierarchical Decomposition**: Breaks down relevant sections into logical sub-components
- **Importance Propagation**: Transfers relevance scores to sub-sections based on parent section rankings
- **Content Summarization**: Extracts most pertinent sentences using extractive summarization

#### 4.2 Refined Text Generation
- **Sentence-level Scoring**: Ranks individual sentences within relevant sections
- **Coherence Preservation**: Maintains logical flow and context in extracted content
- **Length Optimization**: Balances comprehensiveness with conciseness

### 5. Output Generation and Formatting

#### 5.1 JSON Structure Design
Our output follows a standardized, extensible JSON schema:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "input_documents": ["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"],
    "persona_definition": "PhD Researcher in Computational Biology",
    "job_to_be_done": "Literature review preparation",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-07-28T10:30:00Z",
    "total_sections_analyzed": 45,
    "relevance_threshold": 0.75
  },
  "extracted_sections": [
    {
      "document_name": "research_paper.pdf",
      "page_number": 5,
      "section_title": "Methodology",
      "importance_rank": 1,
      "relevance_score": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "sub_section_analysis": [
    {
      "document_name": "research_paper.pdf",
      "page_number": 5,
      "refined_text": "Extracted relevant content..."
    }
  ]
}
```
